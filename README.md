# The Helicopter Game

This is my version of the classic Helicopter Game.
[Click here to see video of original game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xjPxV4kd4)

My version is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The object of the game is to fly the helicopter without crashing into obstacles along the path.
The game will be controlled using a left mouse button hold/release function.
It can be played by 1 or 2 players, and each player will score points based on the distance they can fly the helicopter without crashing into an obstacle.
Each player will have a certain number of lives, and once all lives are used up, the player with the highest score wins.


## Installation

## Features differing from the original game

- 1 or 2 player functionality
- Included buttons to direct user play
- Each player has 3 lives
- The winning score is calculated between all scores in each round
- Displays an all time high score using local storage


## Ideas and Features to work on 

- Adding player customization for players to input their name and choose the color of their helicopter
- Player 1 and 2 alternate turns in each round
- Adding gravity and acceleration to the helicopter
- Changing the border widths to decrease the size of the tunnel and add more difficulty
- Adding sound effects and more animation to the game


## Resources

I referred to Colin Veldkamp's starter code to help me organize and begin coding my game.

I also used various resources (including Google, MDN, W3Schools, YouTube, etc) to learn more about HTML Canvas, aniimation, collision detection functions, and how to use local storage.

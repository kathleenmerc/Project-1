# The Helicopter Game

This is my version of the classic Helicopter Game.  
My version is built using HTML, CSS, HTML Canvas, and JavaScript.  
The object of the game is to fly the helicopter without crashing into obstacles along the path.  
The game is controlled using the left mouse button.  
It can be played by 1 or 2 players, and each player scores points based on the distance they fly the helicopter without crashing into an obstacle.  
Each player has 3 lives and the player with the highest score wins.
